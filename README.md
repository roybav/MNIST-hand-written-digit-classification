# MNIST-hand-written-digit-classification
Machine learning model that classifies a hand-written image to a 0-9 digit.
- Programming language: Python
- IDE: Pycharm
- I used the scikit-learn open-library, in order to run a neural network model that learns the patterns of the training images and tries to predict the classification of the test images.
- Every image was transofmed into a 28x28 pixel-matrix, that was reshaped to a 1x784 row-vector.
- Training set size: 60,000 rows.
- Test set size: 10,000 rows.

1. First, I used the default values of all the parameters of the MLPClassifier function.
